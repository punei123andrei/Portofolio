			<p>
				The whole of the Beinn Damh Estate lies in the parish of Applecross (a'chomraich in gaelic) and thus in former times was part of the lands of the ancient Abbey of Applecross, founded by St Malruba (Maol Rubha) in 673 A.D. Some place names on the estate reflect the fact that they were on the edge of this ecclesiastical property. For many years, the titular Abbot of Applecrcross was drawn from the clan Anrias, the ancient Rosses. Following their fall from grace in the fifteenth century the parish fell into the hands of the nearly related clan Coinnich, the MacKenzies. Indeed the MacKenzies of Applecross held most of the parish until the nineteenth century. Perhaps not surprisingly the principal surname in the area is MacKenzie, though there are many MacDonalds along the North shore of Loch Torridon, approaching Gairloch Parish.
