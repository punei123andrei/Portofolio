The front door swings open and I sheepishly explain my tardiness due to the eight-block-in-total additional excursion. Once inside, scattered about are the usual suspects in terms of tools of the trade: a grain mill, brewing malts, yeast samples. Brewing terminology is tossed about as the boil is started, and I watch as barley is milled. It all seems part and parcel to the beginning of any day in a brewery. Only I’m not in a brewery. I’m in someone’s home; in their kitchen, to be exact. And I’m watching as a husband and wife team get to work on the pilot batch of a variation of their imperial stout that’s already taken home two medals at the Great American Beer Festival. That’s exactly how many times it’s been entered.</p>
